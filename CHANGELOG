------
release: 27 November 2014 

NEW MAJOR VERSION!! syntactically and behaviorally different than the 0.x.x versions

 - Executing the request always returns a HttpResponse[T] instance the contains the response code, headers, and body
 - Exceptions are no longer thrown for 4xx and 5xx response codes. Yay!
 - Http(url) is the starting point for every type of request (post, get, multi, etc)
 - You can easily create your own singleton instance to set your own defaults (timeouts, proxies, etc)
 - Sends "Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate" request header and gunzip/inflates as needed
